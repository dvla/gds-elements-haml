# GOV.UK elements written using Ruby on Rails and HAML  

This project shows how the gov.uk elements can be styled using HAML and Ruby on Rails.   The gov.uk https://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/ web site shows how the elements can be created using HTML and CSS. Developers using HAML need to convert from HTML. This project has taken the govuk-elements web site and converted the code snippets to HAML.   This is intended as a reference guide.
